# MLP Movie Classification

Feature engineering and hyperparameter tun-
ing play a crucial role in machine learning al-
gorithms. In constructing a model to predict
relations for a given movie-related utterance,
feature engineering proved to be an effective
method for improving accuracy. The usage
of dense vector embeddings, batch data pro-
cessing, data shuffling, and data resampling
increased validation accuracy by 3%. Hyperpa-
rameter tuning, such as increasing the learning
rate and decreasing regularization, boosted val-
idation accuracy to 96% and test accuracy to
81%.
